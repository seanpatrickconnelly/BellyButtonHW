// The three cardinal trapezoidal formations hereto made orientable in our 
// diagram by connecting the various points: H-I-G-K, P-E-G-Q and L-M-N-O,
// creating our geometric configurations which have no properties (but with location)
// are equal to the described triangle C-A-B quintuplicated. 
// Therefore also the five triangles composing the aforementioned N-I-G-H. 
// Each are equal to the triangle C-A-B in this geometric concept. Therefore, 
// in a like manner the geometric metaphors can derive a repeated vectoral sum.
